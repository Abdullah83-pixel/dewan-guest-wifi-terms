                        DAE has limited support capabilities for BYOD. All documentation will be provided on the Intranet   and on the wireless networks login page. (Still to be completed!) DAE Technology will also periodically host workshops where staff can enquire about services and setup under the BYOD   program. Community support will also be available in the future on the Intranet, where BYOD users can post information on self-service solutions.

                <p>
                    4.9.1 Staff using a PMD and accessing DAE data or email shall ensure the physical security of the device and immediately report any loss, theft or damage to Regional IT Manager, and where appropriate to the police and report if the device contains any corporate data or email. If the PMD and/or related equipment are subsequently found, the user must immediately notify those parties originally advised of the loss or theft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.9.2 PMD owners shall ensure the physical security of the device if it contains any DAE data or emails or data acquired through 3rd  parties. Owners must ensure that all DAE data is permanently removed from devices prior to leaving the organization. DAE also reserves the right to data wipe the PMD if deemed appropriate.<br>
                    4.9.3 Staff using a PMD and accessing DAE data or email will have device password/PIN and timeout setting established on the device pushed out via the *MDM policy manager. The time out setting the device to go into lock mode must not exceed 10 minutes.

                    4.9.5 Some mobile devices contain portable storage devices (PSD) such as flash memory cards that can be used to store data. Individuals are to ensure the physical security of privately owned PSD’s if they contain DAE data. Staff should consider implementing data encryption on PSD’s dependent on the nature of the data stored. DAE Technology can provide advice in terms of encryption options.

                <p>
                    4.9.6 Sensitive DAE data is not to be stored on PMD’s.

                    4.9.7 Network security credentials (e.g. username and password) must not be stored locally on the PMD unless authorized by the Regional IT Manager. This includes both DAE issued and privately owned mobile devices.
                </p>
                <p>
